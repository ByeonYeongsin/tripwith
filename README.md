How it works & Usage
Watch on YouTube: 
•	Write down the names of the cities you're going to travel to in the search box.
•	If you search for a travel city, you can see a list of travel destinations and a list of current travel companions in the city.
•	If you want to see the travel information, you can click on the travel destination to see a brief introduction, address, photo, and review.
•	If you want to find a travel companion, you can choose one of the chat lists next to you, and you can also enter Category ‘Mate’.
•	Once you've entered the ‘Mate’ category, you'll get filtered search results based on your city, gender, age, and so on.
•	Enter the chat room with people you want to travel with!
•	If you enter the ‘Chat’ category, you can see the chat room you are currently participating in.
